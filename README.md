A CRUD website that i designed and developed.
My stack is: React, Express, SQL.
I have node_modules deleted for size, but kept package.json meaning they can be restored at any point.
It is a Cryptocurrency Exchange, where users can trade, buy, sell and analyze cryptocurrency.
I have included a demonstration MP4 video.
