A CRUD website that i designed and developed.
My stack is: React, Express, SQL.
I have node_modules deleted for size, but kept package.json meaning they can be restored at any point.
Additionally the SQL schema hasnt been uploaded as that was running on local host for testing.
It is a Cryptocurrency Exchange, where users can trade, buy, sell and analyze cryptocurrency.
I have included a demonstration MP4 video.
